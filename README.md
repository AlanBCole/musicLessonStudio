# musicLessonStudio

This is a responsive app built with Angular, Node, Express, bootstrap for styling mostly and of HTML5 and CSS3.

It is an app designed to help students, parents of students, and teachers to communicate in the context of private music lessons.

## Student Pages
a student can log into their notebook by first filling out the form on the home page and thereafter just logging in with email and password.

most things in the student notebook are read only:
  *There is a studio calendar that links with the student's teacher's google calendar.
  *weekly lesson notes
  
a student can edit one thing though, at the bottom of every weeks lesson page there is a comment box where he or she can send messages to the teacher. The student's messages are blue.

## Teacher Pages
a teacher logs in the first time by adding /teacher to the url and filling out the form. Afterward he or she can login using just email and password on the home page.

most things look similar to the student pages with the exceptions:
  *almost all elements are editable.
  *add/delete a weekly lesson page
  *add/delete individual notes within weekly lessons
  *edit text by clicking on it, hit enter to save the change.
  *can also make comments at the bottom of each lesson page, the teacher's comments are red.
  *the calendar is editable but not inside the notebook. Rather that would be done inside google calendar by making a particular calendar public and including its link in the code.
  *above the weekly lesson pages is a "make an announcement" box.
    *When the teacher types here and clicks the '+' there is an announcement is included in every student's most recent lesson      page.
